## School District Analysis
#### Purpose
The original purpose of this analysis was to take data from a school district and analyze it but when there was evidence of academic dishonesty in one of the schools
the point changed to replacing this potentally faulty data. Changing the data effected our original data and in turn the original analysis so it was ran again with 
the new data.
#### Results
* How is the district summary affected?
   The district summary was not effected by much. The school that had its data removed was the only school that had something like this happen.
   It was only one grade level as well althought this data was important to remove its overall impact on the summary is minimal. 
* How is the school summary affected?
  The only school summary that is going to be effected is the summary for Thomas High School. Losing the data from a whole grade level actually improved the overall passing rate and reading rate but hurt the math rate.

  The new scores
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  The overall scores went up. 
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  * Math and reading scores by grade: Thomas High was a high performing school so removing its data will make the overall average lower.
  * Scores by school spending: Thomas High was in the upper-middle range of spending and its removal made that ranges average lower.
  * Scores by school size: Thomas High was a medium sized school and its removal made the averages in that range lower.
  * Scores by school type: Thomas High was a charter school and its removal made the averages for that kind of school lower.
 #### Summary  
  The removal of Thomas High Schools 9th grade scores actually helped Thomas High's overall passing percentage but lowered averages overall in the data.
